"""
portal_hourly.py — shared hourly roll-up helpers for the blended (Shopify ÷ Meta)
portal report.

Why blended and not per-campaign: only ~24% of Shopify orders carry a
utm_campaign, so attributing Shopify revenue to individual campaigns would drop
three quarters of real revenue. At PORTAL grain every order counts, so
    portal ROAS = all Shopify revenue that hour / all Meta spend that hour
is complete and honest. Per-campaign numbers stay on Meta pixel (camp_live.py).

Two source DBs, on two different orphan branches:
  * state/camp_snapshots.db  (branch camp-snapshots) — Meta spend, hourly
  * state/ntn.db             (branch state)          — Shopify orders, timestamped

Spend is stored CUMULATIVE-for-the-day per campaign per hour_slot, so an hourly
delta needs care: a campaign that stops appearing (paused, or dropped by the
impressions>0 filter) would make a naive SUM() fall and produce a negative
delta. We therefore carry each campaign's running max forward, which makes the
portal cumulative monotonic and every delta >= 0.
